Theotihu√°can is an ancient city located around 45km north from Mexico City (CDMX). The easiest and also cheapest way to get there is via bus which will take about 1 hour (depending on the traffic). 


## Getting to Teotihu√°can
The bus station you need to go is called ‚ÄúCentral de autobusses norte‚Äù (Eje Central L√°zaro C√°rdenas 4907, Panamericana, Gustavo A. Madero, 07760 Ciudad de M√©xico, CDMX, Mexiko). You can get there by metro <(insert link to metro article)> or you take an Uber like me üòÇ

Go inside the station and go all the way to the left. One of the last booths will look like this (July 2021).

They only sell roundway tickets for $104 peso in total. This is pretty cheap - round about 4‚Ç¨ to get to and back from Teotihu√°can.

The tickets will look like this. Notice that one has a barcode. This is the ticket you need to drive back. Don't loose it! When it starts to rain in Teotihu√°can many vendors will go home. If you are unlucky the bus ticket vendor too.

Go to gate 7 (or ask which gate you need to take, but it‚Äôs probably gate 7) and get in your bus. They do have a lot of space and you can even store big luggage in the belly if you want, but I recommend against it. Walking Teotihuc√°n is pretty exhausting (note that this region of Mexico is about 2300m above sea level) and you don‚Äôt want to carry additional stuff..

The trip is pretty nice. You can see there different cities which all have a unique touch.

Eventually you will arrive at the entrance of Teotihu√°can. A ticket (valid until you leave the area) costs around 80 peso which is about 3‚Ç¨. As a student you don‚Äôt need to pay anything.

We were lucky, that we had such great weather and that due to the pandemic only a few people were visiting Teotihu√°can.

We means Leo (left), Juan Carlos (right) and me (center). I met those guys via Couchsurfing and I‚Äôm glad I did. Visiting Teotihu√°can is nice but visiting it together with awesome and funny people is even better! ü§©

Leo showed me some cactus leaves with white spots which almost looked like ash. If you squeeze the white stuff it turns red. If you mix it with different compounds (i.e. limestone dust) it changes color. This was used to create all those ancient wall paintings around Meso and South America.

# Eating & Going back

After you exit there are a few restaurants, street food vendors and even bars where you can eat and drink. 
We expected them to be pretty expensive but I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong..

For 80 peso I got 3 enchiladas (picture above) a bowl of rice, salsa, tortillas and 2 quesadilla‚Äôs. It tasted awesome! I was at the first restaurant on the left. I can only recommend it.

![exit](../../../images/mexico/2021/teotihuacan/16.jpeg)
We grabbed a beer and went to the ‚Äúbus station‚Äù back. It is on the street adjacent to the food vendor street next to the exit.  Show your ticket and drive back.


I hope you can find some information useful for your trip to Teotihu√°can. I can recommend it, if you are in in CDMX!

Thank you Leo and Juan Carlos for the great adventure. See you tomorrow on your birthday partyüòç
