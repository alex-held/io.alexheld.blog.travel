Before I can start blogging IN Mexico, I need to get TO Mexico.

This is easier said then done. Atleast in year 2021 with all the legal fallout from the Coronavirus epidemic.

---

My flight route will be as follows:

**FRA** (Frankfurt, Germany) -> **AMS** (Amsterdam, Netherlands) -> **MEX** (Mexico City, Mexico)

**MEX** (Mexico City, Mexico) -> **AMS** (Amsterdam, Netherlands) -> **FRA** (Frankfurt, Germany)

Due to the Coronavirus legislation there are several additional documents I need to provide at different stages of my travel

## GER -> NE

Germany is concidered to be a 'safe' origin for the netherlands (07. July 2021). Therefore I don't need to provide a negative COVID test in addition to my EU COVID Vaccination Certificate.

I need to fill out a `Quarantine Declaration` though. If I don't got a copy of it, I can be fined 95â‚¬.

You can find it [here](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/documents/publications/2021/05/26/quarantine-declaration
)

## AMS -> MEX

Mexico has little to no COVID entry restrictions.
The only requirement is to fill out a questionare [here](https://www.vuelaseguro.com) or inside the Vuelaseguro app on your phone.

## MEX -> NE

If the netherland's goverment speaks about a `NAAT Test`, they usually mean a `PCR Test`.

Since Mexico is consired a high risk country I need to provide such a test which is not older than 72 hours.

In addition to that I need to provide the `Quarantine Declaration` from above and need to "check out" of the Vuelaseguro app.

## AMS -> FRA

To enter germany again I need to register my entry at <https://www.einreiseanmeldung.de/>

A negative COVID PCR test is also required.
